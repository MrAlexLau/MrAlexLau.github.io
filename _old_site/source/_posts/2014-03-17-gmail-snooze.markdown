I'm a huge fan of the app [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) for IOS. In my opinion, its killer feature is the ability to 'snooze' emails, so that they are hidden for the time being, but reappear when they are relevant again.

I wanted to have the same functionality through the Gmail web interface, and while googling I stumbled upon a Gmail [blog post that explains just how to do that](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/gmail-snooze-with-apps-script.html). It turns out that this has actually been available for quite some time (since 2011).

What surprised me even more is that you can write custom javascript scripts to process your email, and that these scripts can be executed on a recurring basis.
