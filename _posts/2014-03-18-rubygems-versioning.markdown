From the [RubyGems guide](http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#semantic_versioning):

> **PATCH** 0.0.x level changes for implementation level detail changes, such as small bug fixes

> **MINOR** 0.x.0 level changes for any backwards compatible API changes, such as new functionality/features

> **MAJOR** x.0.0 level changes for backwards incompatible API changes, such as changes that will break existing users code if they update
