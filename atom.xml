    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Version control &ndash; it&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s also amazing how you don&rsquo;t realize how much better it <em>can</em> be until you use a better tool. Personally, I like to think I&rsquo;ve gone through 4 main &ldquo;stages&rdquo; of version control, each stage being a more useful and effective addition to my workflow than the previous.</p>

<h2>Stage 1 &ndash; Local Backups</h2>

<p><em>&ldquo;Hmmmm, I&rsquo;m planning on making a lot of change to this code, better make a copy of the file <strong>hello.cpp</strong>. I&rsquo;ll call it <strong>hello2.cpp</strong>! I&rsquo;m a genius!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Stage 1 is every n00b&rsquo;s favorite, just making another copy of the file. Something go horribly wrong while you were in that 4am coding frenzy? You&rsquo;ve always got that copy lying around, assuming you had the foresight to make it.</p>

<h2>Stage 2 &ndash; Offsite Backups</h2>

<p><em>&ldquo;Hey (insert programming partner&rsquo;s name here), we&rsquo;re going to need to share our code somehow! How about I work on it Friday night, then email you a zip file of my progress? Then you can work on it Saturday!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Stage 2 is only slightly better than stage 1. As least you (and your partner) have a copy of the code the next time you spill some hot chocolate on your laptop.</p>

<h2>Stage 3 &ndash; Centralized Version Control</h2>

<p><em>&ldquo;Wow, svn is really cool! You can make savepoints in your code?! Other people can get your code too, and contribute to it?!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Using an <strong>actual</strong> version control system for the first time is mindblowing in the omg-why-didn&rsquo;t-I-know-about-this-before kind of way. Once you realize how to commit and branch code, there&rsquo;s no turning back.</p>

<h2>Stage 4 &ndash; Distributed Version Control</h2>

<p><em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really get what the big deal is with git. I mean it&rsquo;s pretty much the same as &ndash; oh wait, oh wait no it&rsquo;s not. Ok. Yes. This is really cool. LET FREEDOM RING.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Just when I was telling my friends how great svn is, git came along and changed everthing. Changes are stored extremely efficiently, making the act of pulling changes quick even when there are a lot of files modified. Branches with git are &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; in that they are easily mergeable with other branches. With git, life is good. With github, life is great. I&rsquo;ll go into that more in another post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> has made my life a lot easier when setting up new mac development environments. To install a new package is as easy as typing <code>brew install mysql</code> on the command line. (Other programs I commonly install with Homebrew are git, mongodb, and postgresql.)</p>

<p>Sometimes you want a program to start a daemon (background) process when you log in. For example, I can start mongodb&rsquo;s daemon with the <code>mongod</code> command, but it&rsquo;d be nicer if it just started automatically.</p>

<p>Fortunately Homebrew has a way to do this! Simply type <code>brew info mongo</code>. If mongod isn&rsquo;t set up to run automatically, the last bit of output will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>To have launchd start mongodb at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mongodb/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load mongodb now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
    mongod
</code></pre>

<p>Note how you not only see how to start mongodb upon login, but also it shows you the name of mongo&rsquo;s daemon process, mongod.</p>
